team member is applicable to the whole team.

round question has been provided, and will not be allowed to change this order
<br><br> 
                                 The question will be provided to each member only at the start of their time
slot, and not before the first member's time slot. Once the question has been
provided, each member can code for 3 minutes at the beginning.<br><br> 
                                In the first 30 minutes, each member can code for 3 mins. In the next 30 mins,
the coding time increases to 4 mins. In the next 30 minutes, coding takes place
for 5 minutes. In the final 30 minutes, each member gets 2 minutes to code.<br><br> 
                                 Duration for the final round is two hours. The teams that get the desired output
in the shortest time stand a chance to win the prize money.<br><br>
